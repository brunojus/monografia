The sentiment analysis is a research area which applies text mining techniques in order to understand the behavior of people.
 Such techniques have been used to recognize patterns and extract information from large databases.
  This work proposes a framework for the identification of patterns in text messages on Twitter social network, allowing us to predict the 
  results of the Brazilian presidential elections in an efficient way. The framework uses natural language processing tools, including the input 
  data preprocessing and the application of machine learning algorithms in order to classify new texts based on previously classified data. 
  The results of the framework are validated through a comparison with the data available on the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) database. 
  According to our results, the solution based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm presents the best performance.
